### Part 2: Music genre classification

#### What becomes possible? The genre of a song can be determined by a ***5-second clip*** of the song! 

Prediction versus true class of 5-sec-music-clips by Naive Bayes

![gnbpredict](https://github.com/yeewantung/AMATH-582/blob/master/hw4/images/gnb_predict.png)

The accuracy of Naive Bayes with cross validation is 0.9953703703703702. 

The accuracy of predicting test set by Naive Bayes is 0.9861111111111112.
